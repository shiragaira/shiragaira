## I'm glad you looked here ðŸ‘‹

My name is **Kacper Frankowski** and I am a **React Developer** with two years of commercial experience.

Programming is more than just a way of life for me. It is a real passion for me and there is no day in which I would not read at least one article from the world of Frontend. In the future, I would like to develop into a Fullstack Developer as well.

Unfortunately I am not able to show you much here at the moment. Most of the work that I had the opportunity to do were corporate projects that I can not make public. I'm currently working to change that, and fill this space with many interesting projects that I already have ideas for. I will try to make this place reflect my level of experience.

But there's always another way for me to show off my skills, and I'm more than happy to take on recruiting assignments.

### I am currently familiar with programming languages such as: 
  - JavaScript
  - TypeScript

### and technologies:
  - React
  - GatsbyJS
  - Eslint
  - Prettier
  - HTML5
  - WordPress + WooCommerce (as headless CMS, i'm not a PHP guy)

### I had the opportunity to work with many libraries from the React and JavaScript environments:
  - Redux
  - React Router Dom
  - Framer Motion
  - React Helmet
  - Toastify
  - axios
  - Formik
  - React Hook Form
  - yup  

### I am able to style the application using (btw. i love styling pages):
  - CSS
  - SCSS
  - CSS-modules
  - Styled Components
  - TailwindCSS

This is actually a small part of what I would like to know. And I am gradually moving towards learning new technologies.

### Currently in planning:
  - Application testing (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
  - NextJS
  - Firebase
